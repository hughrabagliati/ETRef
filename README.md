Eye tracking studies of referential communication tasks, with 3-5yr old children and Adults.

Repository contains anonymized coded data (i.e., no audio files, no names).

For all studies, set the Experiment dir as the working directory before running scripts.

**Experiment 1** assesses adults' utterances and eye movements while completing a referential
communication task, in which ambiguity is created by either semantic or phonological overlap.

**Experiment 2** assesses 4-to-5-year-olds' utterances and eye movements while completing a referential
communication task, in which ambiguity is created by semantic overlap.

**Experiment 3** is not yet added, but assesses 4-to-5-year-olds' performance and eye movements on an explicit ambiguity detection task.

**Experiment 4**  assesses 3-to-4-year-olds' performance on a referential ambiguity task where they must name both ambiguous items. It therefore tests whether young children use production based monitoring.
