Eye tracking studies of referential communication tasks, with 3-5yr old children and Adults.

Repository contains anonymized coded data (i.e., no audio files, no names).

For all studies, except Experiment 3 which is not reported in the paper, the analysis scripts are embedded in the R Markdown Document "RefCommPaper.md". Other analysis scripts within each folder are out of date.

**Experiment 1** assesses adults' utterances and eye movements while completing a referential
communication task, in which ambiguity is created by either semantic or phonological overlap.

**Experiment 2** assesses 4-to-5-year-olds' utterances and eye movements while completing a referential
communication task, in which ambiguity is created by semantic overlap.

**Experiment 3** is not yet added, but assesses 4-to-5-year-olds' performance and eye movements on an explicit ambiguity detection task.

**Experiment 4**  assesses 4-to-5-year-olds' performance on a referential ambiguity task where they must name both ambiguous items. It therefore tests whether young children use production based monitoring.
