Eye tracking studies of referential communication tasks, with 3-5yr old children and Adults.

Repository contains anonymized coded data (i.e., no audio files, no names).

For all studies, set the Experiment dir as the working directory before running scripts.

**Experiment 1** assesses adults' utterances and eye movements while completing a referential
communication task, in which ambiguity is created by either semantic or phonological overlap.
